    "I'm not too familiar with bitwise operators in python. So this is a little learning curve. The bitwise operators in python are <<, >>, &, |, ~, and ^. They operate on numbers (normally) but instead of treating that number as if it were a single value they treat it as if it were a string of bits, written in two's complement binary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two's complement binary numbers for negative integers. Negative numbers are written with a leading one instead of a leading zero. So if you are using only 8 bits for your two's complement then patterns from \"00000000\" to \"01111111\" are the whole numbers from 0 to 127 and reserve \"1xxxxxxx\" for negative numbers. A negative number -x is written using the bit pattern for (x-1) with all of the bits complemented switch from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1. So -1 complement (1-1) = complement(0)=\"11111111\" and -10 = complement(9)=\"11110110\". This means negative numbers go all the way down to -128. This means negative numbers go all the way down to -128 (\"10000000\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, Python doesn't use 8-bit numbers. It used to use however nmany bits were naive to your machine, but since that was non-portable, it now uses an INFINITE number of bits. Thus the number -5 treated by bitwsie operators as it were written \"...111111111111111111101\". (How Sway? a mystery for another day)\n",
