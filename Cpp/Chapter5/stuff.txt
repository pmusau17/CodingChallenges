This what happens when you sit alone with your flow,
tryna grow, on the low, tryna find out if there's more.

Dreaming of yesteryears, and  yesterdays, with my fears
it's kind bleak but i'm sitting here with all my tears,

Justifying all my running in order to truly investing in myself,
but man this solitude is doing a number on my health

Sometimes what you really want is hidden deep inside

Track background can be lina.
